# Scope note: the workflow ran "ruff check ." over the whole repo. That is
# currently 34 findings of pre-existing style debt (UP006 annotations, import
# sorting, and similar) which built up while Actions was switched off, so a
# whole-repo gate would block every push on code nobody is touching. This gates
# CHANGED files instead, the usual way to adopt a linter on a repo with debt:
# new and edited code must be clean, the backlog is reported and not blocking.
# Run "uvx ruff check ." to see the full backlog, or pass --all here.
